# Moolina

A WIP football HTML, CSS and JS game.

Kick the ball with the mouse, and move with the arrow keys or WASD (no online multiplayer yet, only local)

Have fun!


## Running

You will need to run this on a web server, even if running in local; this is because of the /script folder, which will run JavaScript files, and so CORS **will stop you** from running those files in local.

You only really need to clone the repo, copy and paste the folder to a directory where it will be served by the server of your choice, and enter the corresponding URL. The game should load without issues.
